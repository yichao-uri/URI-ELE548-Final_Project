# URI-ELE548-Final_Project

This is a cource project of URI ELE548, an FPGA imlementation of restricted Boltzman machine. 

This project aim to use FPAG to bulid a RBM implementation to accelerate the RBM postive phase computation.

This project is based on PYNQ-Z2 board hardware platform.

RBM_hls and RBM_interface_hls are Vitis HLS project folder, RBM_vivado is Vitis Vivado project folder mainly used to generate FPGA programming files. test file contains the FPGA programming files and Python experiment test file.

final report.pdf is the cource final report.
